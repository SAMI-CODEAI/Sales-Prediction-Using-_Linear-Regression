# SalesVisionLR

## Overview
SalesVisionLR is a machine learning project designed to predict sales outcomes using the Linear Regression algorithm. By analyzing historical sales data and relevant features such as advertising budgets, customer demographics, or product attributes, this project provides accurate sales forecasts to support data-driven business decisions. Ideal for retail, e-commerce, and marketing professionals, SalesVisionLR offers a robust and interpretable solution for sales prediction.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares datasets for analysis, handling missing values and categorical variables.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implements a simple yet powerful regression model to predict sales based on input features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.
- **Visualizations**: Generates plots to visualize relationships between features and sales, aiding in result interpretation.
- **Scalable Framework**: Easily adaptable to various datasets and feature sets for diverse sales prediction scenarios.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SAMI-CODEAI/SalesVisionLR.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SalesVisionLR
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your dataset (e.g., `sales_data.csv`) in the project directory. Ensure it includes features like advertising spend, customer data, or product details, and a target column for sales.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python sales_vision_lr.py
   ```
3. View the results, including:
   - Predicted sales values for test data.
   - Model performance metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, R²).
   - Visualizations such as scatter plots or regression lines.

## Dataset
- **Format**: CSV file (e.g., `sales_data.csv`) with columns for features (e.g., `TV_ad_budget`, `radio_ad_budget`, `customer_age`) and target (`sales`).
- **Example**:
  ```
  TV_ad_budget,radio_ad_budget,customer_age,sales
  230.1,37.8,22,15.6
  44.5,39.3,45,10.4
  ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
